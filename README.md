# Deep Learning Using Keras Tensorflow R Package

This repository contains the code and materials for an assignment that involves using the Keras Tensorflow R package to build multiple regression and classification models.

## Overview
The goal of this assignment was to gain practical experience with the Keras Tensorflow R package, a powerful tool for building and training deep learning models. The assignment focuses on both regression and classification tasks, allowing one to explore different data types and model architectures.

## Prerequisites
Before getting started, make sure you have the following:

- R and RStudio installed on your machine
- Basic understanding of R programming language
- Familiarity with the Keras and Tensorflow libraries

## Getting Started
To get started with the assignment, follow the following steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone git@github.com:mirugwe1/Deep-Learning-Using-R-Keras.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command in RStudio:
```
install.packages(c("keras", "tensorflow"))
```
